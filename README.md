# Java from Scratch 🚀

Welcome to my **Java from Scratch** repository! This project tracks my journey as I learn **Java programming** from the basics and build up to more advanced concepts. I will be updating this repository regularly with solutions to **LeetCode problems**, **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** implementations, and **Java projects** as I progress in my learning.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **`/DSA`** – Implementations of core data structures and algorithms in Java.
- **`/LeetCode`** – Solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by difficulty and topic.
- **`/Projects`** – Small Java projects showcasing practical applications.

## 🚧 Work in Progress
This repository will be regularly updated as I solve more problems and explore Java in greater depth. Stay tuned for new solutions and concepts!

## 🛠️ How to Use
Clone this repository to explore my solutions and experiment with the code:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/RahulRouchanGogoi/Java-from-Scratch.git
cd Java-from-Scratch
